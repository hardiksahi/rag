## Accept user natural language query
## COnvert to Cypher
## Execute query against Neo4J database and retreive results.
## Use retreived results to answer the question
## ALl this possible with GraphCypherQAChain (https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/neo4j/chains/langchain_neo4j.chains.graph_qa.cypher.GraphCypherQAChain.html#)
## We will experiment with prompt tuning to generate cypher queries
## Alternative: Use LLM finetuned on Cypher query dataset

Task:
Generate Cypher query for a Neo4j graph database.

Instructions:
Use only the provided relationship types and properties in the schema.
Do not use any other relationship types or properties that are not provided.

Schema:
{schema}

Note:
Do not include any explanations or apologies in your responses.
Do not respond to any questions that might ask anything other than
for you to construct a Cypher statement. Do not include any text except
the generated Cypher statement. Make sure the direction of the relationship is
correct in your queries. Make sure you alias both entities and relationships
properly. Do not run any queries that would add to or delete from
the database. Make sure to alias all statements that follow as with
statement (e.g. WITH v as visit, c.billing_amount as billing_amount)
If you need to divide numbers, make sure to
filter the denominator to be non zero.

Examples:
# Who is the oldest patient and how old are they?
MATCH (p:Patient)
RETURN p.name AS oldest_patient,
       duration.between(date(p.dob), date()).years AS age
ORDER BY age DESC
LIMIT 1

# Which physician has billed the least to Cigna
MATCH (p:Payer)<-[c:COVERED_BY]-(v:Visit)-[t:TREATS]-(phy:Physician)
WHERE p.name = 'Cigna'
RETURN phy.name AS physician_name, SUM(c.billing_amount) AS total_billed
ORDER BY total_billed
LIMIT 1

# Which state had the largest percent increase in Cigna visits
# from 2022 to 2023?
MATCH (h:Hospital)<-[:AT]-(v:Visit)-[:COVERED_BY]->(p:Payer)
WHERE p.name = 'Cigna' AND v.admission_date >= '2022-01-01' AND
v.admission_date < '2024-01-01'
WITH h.state_name AS state, COUNT(v) AS visit_count,
     SUM(CASE WHEN v.admission_date >= '2022-01-01' AND
     v.admission_date < '2023-01-01' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS count_2022,
     SUM(CASE WHEN v.admission_date >= '2023-01-01' AND
     v.admission_date < '2024-01-01' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS count_2023
WITH state, visit_count, count_2022, count_2023,
     (toFloat(count_2023) - toFloat(count_2022)) / toFloat(count_2022) * 100
     AS percent_increase
RETURN state, percent_increase
ORDER BY percent_increase DESC
LIMIT 1

# How many non-emergency patients in North Carolina have written reviews?
match (r:Review)<-[:WRITES]-(v:Visit)-[:AT]->(h:Hospital)
where h.state_name = 'NC' and v.admission_type <> 'Emergency'
return count(*)

String category values:
Test results are one of: 'Inconclusive', 'Normal', 'Abnormal'
Visit statuses are one of: 'OPEN', 'DISCHARGED'
Admission Types are one of: 'Elective', 'Emergency', 'Urgent'
Payer names are one of: 'Cigna', 'Blue Cross', 'UnitedHealthcare', 'Medicare',
'Aetna'

A visit is considered open if its status is 'OPEN' and the discharge date is
missing.
Use abbreviations when
filtering on hospital states (e.g. "Texas" is "TX",
"Colorado" is "CO", "North Carolina" is "NC",
"Florida" is "FL", "Georgia" is "GA, etc.)

Make sure to use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL when analyzing missing properties.
Never return embedding properties in your queries. You must never include the
statement "GROUP BY" in your query. Make sure to alias all statements that
follow as with statement (e.g. WITH v as visit, c.billing_amount as
billing_amount)
If you need to divide numbers, make sure to filter the denominator to be non
zero.
